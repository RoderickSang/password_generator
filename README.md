# Password Generator

Solo project completed from Scrimba.com's Front-End Developer path.

The requirements were to have the website generate two random passwords when the user clicks the password, and each password should be 15 characters long
The design of the website was given to us through [this Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/NEj9JDycMjF3XKXq7swoc9/Random-Password-Generator-(New-version)?node-id=0%3A1).
